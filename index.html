          <p>Theater started in downtown Manhattan and gradually moved north. By 1870, Union Square was the center of Broadway. By 1900, many theaters had reached Madison Square. The early 1900s saw the first few theaters around Times Square. A large number of theaters were built in Times Square during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
          
          <p>The building of Broadway theaters coincided with the development of the electric light bulb. From <em>Wikipedia:</em></p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p id="broadwaylights">The invention of the electric light bulb paved the way for the famous electric signage, which characterizes Times Square. The first electric billboard for the play, <em>The Red Mill,</em> was illuminated in 1903. Other theaters followed this trend, and soon all of Broadway was illuminated with electric signage and referred to as “The Great White Way.” In 1927, the neon light was invented, bringing in a flush of new vibrant colored lights for billboards in Times Square.</p></blockquote>
    
          <p>Today, most Broadway theaters are owned by just three companies: the Shubert Organization with 17 theaters, the Nederlander Organization with 9 theaters, and Jujamcyn Theaters with 5. Other theater owners include Second Stage, Roundabout Theatre Company, Ambassador Theatre Group, Circle in the Square, Disney Theatrical Productions, Lincoln Center Theater, and Manhattan Theatre Club.</p>

        <p>The full name of the Tony Awards is The Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre. 
        <p>Mary Antoinette Perry was an actress and director. She directed the Pulitzer-Prize winning show <em>Harvey,</em> which was later turned into a film starring James Stewart. She was one of the founders of the American Theatre Wing, an organization that provided entertainment to servicemen during  World War II. It also operated Stage Doors Canteens.</p>
        <p>To be considered for a Tony Award, a theater must have more than 500 seats and be located in the Theater District. About 40 theaters in New York meet those requirements.</p>
